\section{\Huge Performance Summary with knitR and R}
{\large Here is a little experiment with R, knitr, and XeLaTeX to produce a performance report.  I have done some samples in the past, but I wanted to iterate through a couple more, especially to evaluate other options for what has been started in the PApages package.  Of course, this text could be easily replaced with some commentary from a manager about opportunities, thoughts, or current allocation. A dashboard set of charts also might be very helpful here.}
